Chicken Scheme bindings to the [Chipmunk 7 physics library](https://chipmunk-physics.net)

This project is still in development, if you are looking for a stable bindings egg consider using [Pluizer's chicken-chipmunk](https://github.com/pluizer/chicken-chipmunk)

### Installation

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/ChrisBlom/chicken-chipmunk-7
	cd chicken-chipmunk-7
	chicken-install

### Credits

chipmunk-callbacks.scm is adapted (poorly...) from another chipmunk binding by Kristian Lein-Mathisen, [acorn](https://github.com/kristianlm/acorn)
